In this project, unsupervised learning techniques are applied to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. Jupyter Notebook (`Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb`)  was used to work through the following steps:  
1. Preprocessing
2. Feature Transformation
3. Clustering
